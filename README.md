# _Das Schloss_

Franz Kafka.

I've been reading and translating _Das Schloss_ to learn German. There's no
reason in particular to have this on GitHub, but I'm version controlling it
anyway, so here you go. CC BY-SA 4.0 or later, please.

Please do not rely on this for anything remotely meaningful.
