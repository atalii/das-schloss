# _Das Schloss_

Franz Kafka.

I've been reading and translating _Das Schloss_ to learn German. There's no
reason in particular to have this on GitHub, but I'm version controlling it
anyway, so here you go. CC BY-SA 4.0 or later, please.

Please do not rely on this for anything remotely meaningful.

## Bibliography

The work translated is _Das Schloss_ by Franz Kafka. (My hard copy seems to
have little more information on publisher, &c.)

In points of confusion, I occaisonally refer to Anthea Bell's translation for
Oxford World Classics (2009), though she appears to be working off a different
edition of the original text, notably moving the first two paragraphs of
chapter 2 into the end of chapter 1.
