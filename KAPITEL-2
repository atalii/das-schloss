When they were almost at the inn --- K. recognized it by a bend in the road ---
it was already almost completely dark. Was he really away for that long? Only
one, maybe two hours by his calculation. He had left in the morning, he was
never hungry, and until recently there had a been a regular daytime bell, but
now there was darkness. "Short days, short days," he said to himself, leaving
the sled and approaching the inn.

Above the small front stairs, the host welcomed him and shone a raised lantern
towards him. Fleetingly having remembered his driver, K. remained where he was
as someone coughed in the darkness; that was him. He would probably see
him soon again. First, when he was over by the host, humbly greeting him, he
saw, on either side of the door, a man. He took the lantern out of the host's
hand and illuminated the two: It was the men that he had met earlier; the ones
who were called Artur and Jeremias. Now, they saluted. In memory of his
time in the military, an these happy times, he smiled. "Who are you?" he asked,
and looked from one to the other. "Your help," they answered. "It's the help,"
confirmed the host, softly. "What?" asked K., "You're my old help, who I had
come after me, who I was waiting for?" They affirmed this. "That's good," said
K., after a while. "It's good that you've come." --- "By the way," said K.,
after an even longer while, "You're quite late; you've been very negligent."
--- "It was a long way," said one of them. "A long way," repeated K, "but I met
you both when you were coming from the castle." --- "Yes," they said, without
further explanation. "Where did you put the equipment?" asked K. "We don't have
it," they said. "The equipment, that I entrusted to you," said K. "We don't
have anything," they repeated. "Oh, be like that!" said K., "Do you know
anything of surveying?" --- "No," they said. "If you're my old help, you've got
to know about that," said K. They were silent. "So come along," said K., and
took them into the house.

So the three of them just sat silently at a tiny table in the inn with their
beers. K. were in the middle, on either side were his help. Aside from them,
there only a table filled with farmers, just like the last evening. "There's
something difficult with you both," K. said, and compared their faces as he had
often already done, "How should I distinguish you? You're different only in
name; completely identical otherwise" --- he stalled involuntarily here ---
"You're as similar as any two snakes." They laughed. "Others are well able to
tell us apart," they said in justification. "I believe you," K. said, "I was
witness to that myself, but I only see with my eyes, and I can't distinguish
you with those. So I'll treet you both like a single man and call you both
Artur. At least that's one of you. Maybe you?" asked K. to one of them. "No,"
that one said, "I'm Jeremias." --- "Well, it's the same either way," said K.,
"I'll call you both Artur. If I send Artur somewhere, you both go. If I give
Artur some work, you both do it. That's really got a big disadvantage for me: I
can't put you both to separate tasks. But there's an advantage: You're both
responsible for everything I ask of you. It's all the same to me how you divide
the work, just don't make excuses for each other, you're as one man to me."
They thought about this for a second and said, "That would be quite unpleasant
for us." --- "How wouldn't it be?" said K., "Of course it'll be unpleasant, but
that's how it'll be." Before any real time had passed, K. saw one of the
farmers sneaking around the table. He had finally made up his mind, going to
one of his helpers to whisper something to him. "Please," sadi K., hitting his
hand on the table and standing up. "These are my helpers, and we're having a
meeting. No one has the right to disturb us." --- "Oh, please, please," said
the farmer fearfully, going right back to his table. "You need to observe
this," said K., sitting agiain. "You must not speak to anyone without my
permission. I'm foreign here, and if you're my old assisstants, then you're
foreign, too. So we three foreigners need to stick together. Give me your
hands." They stretched their hands out to K. all too willingly. "Put your paws
away," he said, "But my command is still valid. I'm going to sleep now, and I
advise you to do the same. We missed a workday today, so we'll need to start
early tomorrow. You must provide a sled with which we can go to the castle. Be
ready at 7."
