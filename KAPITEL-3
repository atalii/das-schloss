In the bar, in the wholly empty middle of the room, some farmers were sitting
on the walls of barrels, though they seemed different than those in the K.'s
inn. They wore, more neatly and more uniformly, gray-ish yellow, rough clothes;
their jackets were inflated, their panst closely fitted. At first glance, they
seemed to have very similarly flat, bony, and round-cheeked faces. Everyone was
quiet and hardly moving, only acknowledging the entrance with their glances,
though only slowly and with indifference. Despite that, they exerted, because
there were so many and it was so quiet, a certain effect on K. He took Olga's
arm again, using it to explain his presence here to the people. In one corner,
a man stood up, an acquaintance of Olga's, and wanted to go up to her,, but K.
turned them around in another direction with his interlocked arm.  No one but
she could have notice, and she tolerated it with a sideways smile.

The beer was delivered by a young girl named Frieda. She was an inconspicuous,
small, blonde girl with sad eyes and thin cheeks, but she had a surprising look
of some special superiority. When this gaze fell upon K., it seemed to him that
this gaze identified some relevant things in K., the existence of which he
himself knew nothing about; the existence of which shown with that look. K.
didn't listen to Frieda speak over from his side, even as she was already
speaking with Olga. Olga and Frieda did not appear to be friends; they
exchanged only a few cold words. K. wanted to help, asking abruptly: "Do you
know Mr. Klamm?" Olga laughed. "Why aer you laughing?" asked K., annoyed. "No,
no, I'm not laughing," she said, but laughing more. "So Olga's a real childish
girl," said K. and bent far over the table to firmly see Frieda's expression
again. But she stopped him and said lightly, "Would you like to see Mr. Klamm?"
K. said yes. She pointed to a door just left of them. "Here's a small peephole,
you can look through it." --- "And the people here?" asked K. She rose her
lower lip up and lead K. with an incredibly soft hand to the door. Through the
small peephole, obviously drilled for this purposoe, he almost saw the whole
next-door room.

At a desk in the middle of the room, on a comfortable, round chair sat, luridly
lit by a light bulb hung down before him, Mr. Klamm. He was a man of average
height, fat, wide, and clumsy in appearance. His face was smooth, but his
cheeks were weighed down already by the weight of age. His black mustache was
grown out long.

A pair of obliquely worn eyeglasses hid his eyes in reflections. If Mr. Klamm
had fully sat by the table, K. would have only seen him in profile, but here he
was strongly turned around and K. could see his whole face. K. had laid his
left elbow on the table and his right hand, in which he held Virginia tobacco,
rested on his knee. A beer glass was on the table; though the edge of the table
was high there, so K. couldn't quite see whether there were any papers or
writings on the desk, though it seemed to him as though it were empty. To be
safe, he asked Frieda to look through the lock and to give him some information
about it. She, however, had been in the room a little while ago, and could
quickly confirm that there were no papers there. K. asked Frieda whether he
needed to go soon, but she said he could look as long as he liked. K. was now
alone with Frieda, Olga had, as he quickly saw, walked away to find her
acquaintances, sitting high on a barrell and kciking her feet. "Fridea," said
K., whispering, "You know Mr. Klamm quite well!" --- "Oh yes," she said. "Very
well." She leaned near K. and playfully adjusted what K. just now noticed was a
light, low-cut, cream colored blouse, fitted somewhat strangely for her body.
Then she said: "Do you not remember Olga's laugh?" --- "Yes, she's very
impolite," said K. "Now," she said, in a concillatory tone, "there was reason
to laugh. She asked if I knew Klamm, and I'm" --- here she instinctively raised
herself up a little, and again her triumphant expression was directed at K.,
seemingly unconnected to what she said, "I'm his lover." --- "Klamm's lover,"
said K. She nodded. "Then to me," K. said, smiling, in order not to let too
much seriousness show between them, "you are a respectable person." --- "Not
just for you," said Fridea, friendlily, but without taking up the same smile.
K. had something for her pride and applied it; he asked: "Have you been in the
castle?" But it didn't catch as she answered: "No, but isn't it enough that I'm
here in this bar?" Her ambition was obviously great, and it seemed now to K.
that she wanted his compliments. "Of course," K. said, "Here in this bar, you
understand the host's work." --- "So it is," she said, "and I began as a stable
maid at the 'Wood Inn.'" --- "With these delicate hands?" said K., half asking,
and himself not knowing whether he was flattering her or if she really defeated
him. Indeed, her hands were small and smooth, though they could also be called
strong. "No one's respected me then for that," she said, "and even now ---" K.
looked inquiringly. She shook her head and didn't want to go on. "Of course,"
said K., "you have your secrets, and you won't reveal them to just anyone whom
you've known for half an hour and who had no opportunity to explain, actually,
how he is."
