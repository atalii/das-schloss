It was late into the afternoon when K. arrived. The village was deep in snow,
and there was nothing to see from Schloßberg. Fog and darkness surrounded
him. K. stood on the wooden bridge that lead from the country road
to the village for a long time and looked out at the seeming emptiness above.
Then he went to find somewhere to spend the night; an inn where one was still
awake. But the host had no rooms to rent, although he would allow the late guest,
K., extremely surprised and confused, to sleep on a haysack. A few farmers were
sat with their beers, but wanting to talk to nobody, K. took the haystack from
the attic and laid it out near the ovens. It was warm, the farmers were quiet,
he examined yet little with his tired eyes, and so it was that he went to sleep.

He was awoken a short time later. A young man, stately dressed, with an actor's
face, small eyes, and strong eyebrows stood with the host next to K. The
farmers were still there, a few having turned their armchairs around in order
to better see and hear. The young man apologized with the hope of waking
K., introduced himself as the son of the castle, and then said: "This
village is property of the castle; everyone who lives and stays the night here
lives or stays the night, we may say, in the castle. And that is not allowed
without the Count's permission. But you don't have that permission, or, at
least, you have not shown it."

K. had half woken up, pattted his hair, glanced at the people from around him
and said, "In which village have I ended up? Is there, then, a castle here?"

"Indeed," said the young man, slowly, here and there shaking his head at K.:
"the castle of Count Westwest."

"And one needs to have permission to stay overnight?" asked K., as though he
were convincing himself that he hadn't just dreamed the earlier message,

"One needs to have the Count's permission," was the answer, and therein was a
large mockery for K., when the young man, with outstretched arms, asked the
host and guests: "But do you not need that permission?"

"Then I will need to get the Count's permission." said K., yawning and shoving
his blanket away as though he were just waking.

"And from whom?" asked the young man.

"From the Count." said K., "No one else will be left."

The young man cried, "Now, in the middle of the night, get permission from the
count?" taking a step backward.

"Is that not possible?" asked K., calmly. "Why, then, did you wake me up?"

Now the young man was beside himself. "Delinquent manners!" he screamed. "I
demand respect for the Count's institution! I woke you to tell you that you
must leave his land as soon as possible!"

"Quit the jokes," said K. remarkably softly, and laid back down, pulling the
blanket over him. "You're going, young man, a little too far, and I'll come
back to your problems in the morning. The host and the gentlemen are witnesses,
insofar as I need witnesses anyway, but let it be said that I am the surveyor
that the Count has allowed to come. My assisstants will come tomorrow with the
equipment in the car. I didn't want to let myself miss the snow, but
unfortunately I strayed from the path and therefore arrived so late. I knew,
prior to your instruction, that it's now too late to raise my hand at the
castle. So I satisfied myself with this inn here, that — to say the least —
your rudeness disturbed. With this I finish my explanation. Good night, sir."
And K. turned to the oven.

He heard "Surveyor?" asked hesitantly behind his back, and then everything was
quiet. But the young man quickly put himself together and said to the host in a
tone weak enough in consideration of K.'s sleep, and loud enough to be
understood: "I'll ask over the phone." How was there a telephone in this
village inn? It was excellently furnished. To the singularly surprised K., he
had everything he expected. It was revealed that the telephone was,
appropriately, almost over his head; something he had overlooked in his
exhaustion. If the young man had to make a call, he could not, even by his best
will, accomodate K.'s sleep, and because the call should concern K., he decided
to tolerate it. It made, then, no sense to play with the sleeping man, and he
therefore returned to lying on his back. He saw the farmers shyly move together
and talk to each other. The arrival of a surveyor was not insignificant. The
door of the kitchen was opened, and there stood the powerful body of the host's
wife, whom the host approached on tiptoe to report to. And so began the call.
The housekeeper was sleeping, but one of his aids among the staff, a Mr. Fritz,
was there. The young man, who introduced himself as Schwarzer, explained how he
found K., a man in his thirties, rightly battered, sleeping peacefully on a
haystack, with a little rucksack as a pillow, and a cane in his surroundings.
Now he was of course suspicious, and the host had apparently neglected his
duty, such as it's his, Schwarzer's, duty known, to attend to the things on the
ground. The awakening, the interrogation, K.'s very ungrateful response to
the dutiful threat of expulsion, how it finally happened, perhaps with truth,
that he claimed to be a surveyor of the Count. Of course it's just a formality
to check the claim, and Schwarzer therefore asked Mr. Fritz to in inquire to
the central office if a surveyor of this kind was really expected, and to call
back with the answer to the same.

Then it was quiet. Fritz inquired on his side, and here they waited for the
answer. K. remained as he was up to now; he turned about not once; seemed
absolutely uncurious; and looked ahead. Schwarzer's introduction, in its
mixture of malice and caution, gave him an idea of, so to speak, the diplomatic
upbringing, which, in the castle, even small people like Schwarzer could
dispose of. They were not lacking of dilligence there; the central office had
its night shift. Often there were, too, very quick answers, and Fritz was soon
called. This report seemed at least quite short, and suddenly Schwarzer threw
the receiver down in anger. "I told you so!" he shrieked. "No trace of a
surveyor; a common, lying vagrant, and probably worse." For a moment K. thought
that all of them --- Schwarzer, the farmers, the host and his wife, all of them
--- would topple him. At least he could evade the first rush, hiding under the
ceiling. Then the telephone rang, as it seemed to K., especially strongly. He
slowly stuck his head out. Although it was unlikely that it woudl concern K.,
everyone faltered, and Schwarzer came back to the appliance. There he heard a
long explanation and said, softly: "A mistake, then? That's quite unpleasant to
me. The office leader himself called? Odd, odd. How should I explain this to
the surveyor?"

K. listened on. The castle had named him the surveyor. That was on the one hand
unfavorible to him because it showed that everyone in the castle knew
everything necessary about him, the ballance of power had shifted, and he had a
smile on his face. But on the other hand, it was favorable, since it proved his
opinion that he was underestimated and that he would have more freedom, as he
had previously allowed himself to hope. And if one believes, through this
certain acceptance of superiority, that his surveyorship could constantly come
to frighten him, so it was that one was mistaken; It easily overlooked him, but
that was everything.

K. waved shyly to the approaching Schwarzer, who was moving into the host's
room wherein he was urged and refused to accept only a nightcap from the
host and a sink with soap and a hand towel from his wife. He certainly needn't
have demanded that the hall was emptied, since everyone already left, averting
their faces in order not to be recognized in the morning. The light was
extinguished, and he finally found some rest. He slept deeply, hardly disturbed
by the scurrying rats, fleeing to the morning.
