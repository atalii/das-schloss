It was late into the afternoon when K. arrived. The village was deep in snow,
and there was nothing to see from Schloßberg. Fog and darkness surrounded
him. K. stood on the wooden bridge that lead from the country road
to the village for a long time and looked out at the seeming emptiness above.
Then he went to find somewhere to spend the night; an inn where one was still
awake. But the host had no rooms to rent, although he would allow the late guest,
K., extremely surprised and confused, to sleep on a haysack. A few farmers were
sat with their beers, but wanting to talk to nobody, K. took the haystack from
the attic and laid it out near the ovens. It was warm, the farmers were quiet,
he examined yet little with his tired eyes, and so it was that he went to sleep.

He was awoken a short time later. A young man, stately dressed, with an actor's
face, small eyes, and strong eyebrows stood with the host next to K. The
farmers were still there, a few having turned their armchairs around in order
to better see and hear. The young man apologized with the hope of waking
K., introduced himself as the son of the castle, and then said: "This
village is property of the castle; everyone who lives and stays the night here
lives or stays the night, we may say, in the castle. And that is not allowed
without the Count's permission. But you don't have that permission, or, at
least, you have not shown it."

K. had half woken up, pattted his hair, glanced at the people from around him
and said, "In which village have I ended up? Is there, then, a castle here?"

"Indeed," said the young man, slowly, here and there shaking his head at K.:
"the castle of Count Westwest."

"And one needs to have permission to stay overnight?" asked K., as though he
were convincing himself that he hadn't just dreamed the earlier message,

"One needs to have the Count's permission," was the answer, and therein was a
large mockery for K., when the young man, with outstretched arms, asked the
host and guests: "But do you not need that permission?"

"Then I will need to get the Count's permission." said K., yawning and shoving
his blanket away as though he were just waking.

"And from whom?" asked the young man.

"From the Count." said K., "No one else will be left."

The young man cried, "Now, in the middle of the night, get permission from the
count?" taking a step backward.

"Is that not possible?" asked K., calmly. "Why, then, did you wake me up?"

Now the young man was beside himself. "Delinquent manners!" he screamed. "I
demand respect for the Count's institution! I woke you to tell you that you
must leave his land as soon as possible!"

"Quit the jokes," said K. remarkably softly, and laid back down, pulling the
blanket over him. "You're going, young man, a little too far, and I'll come
back to your problems in the morning. The host and the gentlemen are witnesses,
insofar as I need witnesses anyway, but let it be said that I am the surveyor
that the Count has allowed to come. My assisstants will come tomorrow with the
equipment in the car. I didn't want to let myself miss the snow, but
unfortunately I strayed from the path and therefore arrived so late. I knew,
prior to your instruction, that it's now too late to raise my hand at the
castle. So I satisfied myself with this inn here, that — to say the least —
your rudeness disturbed. With this I finish my explanation. Good night, sir."
And K. turned to the oven.

He heard "Surveyor?" asked hesitantly behind his back, and then everything was
quiet. But the young man quickly put himself together and said to the host in a
tone weak enough in consideration of K.'s sleep, and loud enough to be
understood: "I'll ask over the phone." How was there a telephone in this
village inn? It was excellently furnished. To the singularly surprised K., he
had everything he expected. It was revealed that the telephone was,
appropriately, almost over his head; something he had overlooked in his
exhaustion. If the young man had to make a call, he could not, even by his best
will, accomodate K.'s sleep, and because the call should concern K., he decided
to tolerate it. It made, then, no sense to play with the sleeping man, and he
therefore returned to lying on his back. He saw the farmers shyly move together
and talk to each other. The arrival of a surveyor was not insignificant. The
door of the kitchen was opened, and there stood the powerful body of the host's
wife, whom the host approached on tiptoe to report to. And so began the call.
The housekeeper was sleeping, but one of his aids among the staff, a Mr. Fritz,
was there. The young man, who introduced himself as Schwarzer, explained how he
found K., a man in his thirties, rightly battered, sleeping peacefully on a
haystack, with a little rucksack as a pillow, and a cane in his surroundings.
Now he was of course suspicious, and the host had apparently neglected his
duty, such as it's his, Schwarzer's, duty known, to attend to the things on the
ground. The awakening, the interrogation, K.'s very ungrateful response to
the dutiful threat of expulsion, how it finally happened, perhaps with truth,
that he claimed to be a surveyor of the Count. Of course it's just a formality
to check the claim, and Schwarzer therefore asked Mr. Fritz to in inquire to
the central office if a surveyor of this kind was really expected, and to call
back with the answer to the same.

Then it was quiet. Fritz inquired on his side, and here they waited for the
answer. K. remained as he was up to now; he turned about not once; seemed
absolutely uncurious; and looked ahead. Schwarzer's introduction, in its
mixture of malice and caution, gave him an idea of, so to speak, the diplomatic
upbringing, which, in the castle, even small people like Schwarzer could
dispose of. They were not lacking of dilligence there; the central office had
its night shift. Often there were, too, very quick answers, and Fritz was soon
called. This report seemed at least quite short, and suddenly Schwarzer threw
the receiver down in anger. "I told you so!" he shrieked. "No trace of a
surveyor; a common, lying vagrant, and probably worse." For a moment K. thought
that all of them --- Schwarzer, the farmers, the host and his wife, all of them
--- would topple him. At least he could evade the first rush, hiding under the
ceiling. Then the telephone rang, as it seemed to K., especially strongly. He
slowly stuck his head out. Although it was unlikely that it woudl concern K.,
everyone faltered, and Schwarzer came back to the appliance. There he heard a
long explanation and said, softly: "A mistake, then? That's quite unpleasant to
me. The office leader himself called? Odd, odd. How should I explain this to
the surveyor?"

K. listened on. The castle had named him the surveyor. That was on the one hand
unfavorible to him because it showed that everyone in the castle knew
everything necessary about him, the ballance of power had shifted, and he had a
smile on his face. But on the other hand, it was favorable, since it proved his
opinion that he was underestimated and that he would have more freedom, as he
had previously allowed himself to hope. And if one believes, through this
certain acceptance of superiority, that his surveyorship could constantly come
to frighten him, so it was that one was mistaken; It easily overlooked him, but
that was everything.

K. waved shyly to the approaching Schwarzer, who was moving into the host's
room wherein he was urged and refused to accept only a nightcap from the
host and a sink with soap and a hand towel from his wife. He certainly needn't
have demanded that the hall was emptied, since everyone already left, averting
their faces in order not to be recognized in the morning. The light was
extinguished, and he finally found some rest. He slept deeply, hardly disturbed
by the scurrying rats, fleeing to the morning.

After breakfast, which, like the totality of K.'s accomodations, per the
castle's host, K. would have to pay for, K. wanted to quickly go to the
village. But there the host, with whom he had, until now, according to his
memories of yesterday's behavior, only spoken to for necessities, continuously
turning him around with mute pleas, took pity on him and let K. sit by him for
a little while.

"I don't yet know the Count," said K., "He should pay good work with good
money, no? If one, like me, travels so far from their wife and kids, then he'd
want to bring something home."

"From this point of view, the man needn't worry about poor compensation; nobody
hears of bad payment." --- "Now," said K., "I'm not a shy person, and I can
tell the Count my opinion, but of course it would be better to become peaceful
with the man."

The host sat K. opposite the windowsill's edge, and calmly dared him not to
sit, seeing K. the whole time with large, brown, fearful eyes. First he pushed
K. close, and now it seemed as though he would much prefer to run away. Did he
fear for how the Count would interrogate him? Did he fear the unreliability of
the man whom he considered K. to be? K. must have distracted him. K. looked at
the clock and said, "Now, my help will come soon, would you be able to
accomodate them here?"

"Certainly, sir," he said, "They won't stay with you in the castle?"

Wouldn't he love to so easily do away with K. and the guests, whom he had
certainly left to the castle?

"I'm not sure," K. said K., "First, I need to learn what work they have for me.
Should I, for example, work down here, it'd be more reasonable to stay down
here. I also fear that life up in the castle wouldn't be for me. I always want to
be free."

"You don't know the castle," the host said lightly.

"Yes," said K., "one shouldn't be so quick to judge. I certainly don't know
anything more about the castle than they know about picking the right land
surveyor. Maybe there's no other virtue there." Then he stood to free himself
from the unrest of the biting host's lip. It wasn't simple to gain the trust of
this man.

While leaving, K. saw a dark portrait in a dark frame. He'd noticed it from his
earlier position, but he hadn't distinguished it, and believed that the actual
image was taken away from the frame, and only a black backing remained to be
seen. But there was a picture, now showing the portrait of a man in his
fifties. He bowed his head so low in the frame that one could hardly see
anything of his eyes, and the tall, heavy forhead was seemingly crucial for
that lowering, as was his strong, downwarldy curved nose. A full beard grew,
due to his head's positioning's pointed pressure on his chin, even farther
below him. His left hand was spread into his full hair, though his head
couldn't rise any more. "Who is that?" asked K., "The Count?" K. stood before
the image, not looking back at the host. "No," said the host, "the Castellan."
--- "You certainly have a beautiful Castellan in your castle," said K., "it's a
shame that his son turned out so poorly."a "No.," said the host, pulling K.
down a little, and whispeering in his ear: "Schwarzer exaggerated yesterday.
His father is just an undercastellan and, even then, one of the last." At that
moment, K. seemed like a kid to the host. "That bastard!" said K., laughing,
but the host didn't laugh along, saying instead: "But his father is powerful."
"Bah!" sadi K., "You think everyone has power. Me, too?" "You," he said shyly
but seriously, "I do not think you have power." "So you just don't understand
how well to observe," said K., "I am not powerful by name; really I am not. And
so I have no less respect for the powerful than you, only I'm not as
honest as you, and don't want always to admit it." And K. tapped the host's
cheek in order to console him and to make himself more agreeable. So now he
smiled a little. He was really a young man with his soft, beardless face. How
had he come to have his old wife, who could be seen next door behind a
peephole, far from the elbows of her love, managing the kitchen? But K. didn't
want to inquire any further into the host, chasing away that final smile. So he
gave him only a wink, opened the door for him, and stepped out into the bright
winter morning.

So it was that he saw the castle above, distinctly outlined in the clear air,
further revealed by the thin layer of snow resting everywhere. There seemed to
be much less snow on the mountain than here in the village, where K. had
arduously brought himself forward no less than yesterday on the country road.
Here, the snow reached to the windows of the cabin and weighed down the roof,
but over on the mountain everything stuck out freely and simply upwards,
seeming little like here.

Everything about the castle --- how it showed itself here from the distance ---
was as K. expected. It was neither an old construction nor some new monument,
but a creation expanded with time that consisted of few two-story areas,
but plenty of lower, close-together constructions; if one didn't know that this
was meant to be a castle, one could take it for some little city. K. saw just
one tower, though, if it belonged to a living space or a church, he couldn't
tell. Swarms of crows surrounded it.
