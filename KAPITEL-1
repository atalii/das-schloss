It was late into the afternoon when K. arrived. The village was deep in snow,
and there was nothing to see from Schloßberg. Fog and darkness surrounded
him. K. stood on the wooden bridge that lead from the country road
to the village for a long time and looked out at the seeming emptiness above.
Then he went to find somewhere to spend the night; an inn where one was still
awake. But the host had no rooms to rent, although he would allow the late guest,
K., extremely surprised and confused, to sleep on a haysack. A few farmers were
sat with their beers, but wanting to talk to nobody, K. took the haystack from
the attic and laid it out near the ovens. It was warm, the farmers were quiet,
he examined yet little with his tired eyes, and so it was that he went to sleep.

He was awoken a short time later. A young man, stately dressed, with an actor's
face, small eyes, and strong eyebrows stood with the host next to K. The
farmers were still there, a few having turned their armchairs around in order
to better see and hear. The young man apologized with the hope of waking
K., introduced himself as the son of the castle, and then said: "This
village is property of the castle; everyone who lives and stays the night here
lives or stays the night, we may say, in the castle. And that is not allowed
without the Count's permission. But you don't have that permission, or, at
least, you have not shown it."

K. had half woken up, pattted his hair, glanced at the people from around him
and said, "In which village have I ended up? Is there, then, a castle here?"

"Indeed," said the young man, slowly, here and there shaking his head at K.:
"the castle of Count Westwest."

"And one needs to have permission to stay overnight?" asked K., as though he
were convincing himself that he hadn't just dreamed the earlier message,

"One needs to have the Count's permission," was the answer, and therein was a
large mockery for K., when the young man, with outstretched arms, asked the
host and guests: "But do you not need that permission?"

"Then I will need to get the Count's permission." said K., yawning and shoving
his blanket away as though he were just waking.

"And from whom?" asked the young man.

"From the Count." said K., "No one else will be left."

The young man cried, "Now, in the middle of the night, get permission from the
count?" taking a step backward.

"Is that not possible?" asked K., calmly. "Why, then, did you wake me up?"

Now the young man was beside himself. "Delinquent manners!" he screamed. "I
demand respect for the Count's institution! I woke you to tell you that you
must leave his land as soon as possible!"

"Quit the jokes," said K. remarkably softly, and laid back down, pulling the
blanket over him. "You're going, young man, a little too far, and I'll come
back to your problems in the morning. The host and the gentlemen are witnesses,
insofar as I need witnesses anyway, but let it be said that I am the surveyor
that the Count has allowed to come. My assisstants will come tomorrow with the
equipment in the car. I didn't want to let myself miss the snow, but
unfortunately I strayed from the path and therefore arrived so late. I knew,
prior to your instruction, that it's now too late to raise my hand at the
castle. So I satisfied myself with this inn here, that — to say the least —
your rudeness disturbed. With this I finish my explanation. Good night, sir."
And K. turned to the oven.

He heard "Surveyor?" asked hesitantly behind his back, and then everything was
quiet. But the young man quickly put himself together and said to the host in a
tone weak enough in consideration of K.'s sleep, and loud enough to be
understood: "I'll ask over the phone."
