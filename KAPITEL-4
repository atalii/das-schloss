He would have liked to speak trustfully with Frieda, but the assistants, with
whom, by the way, Frieda was also joking and laughing with here and there,
prevented him from such conversation with their bare and obtrusive presence.
They were, all considered, not hard to please, having placed themselves in a
corner of the floor on top of two old skirts. It was as though they had talked
frequently with Frieda; their ambitions were to not disturb the Mr. Surveyor
and to take up as little room as possible, and, in this respect, they made, of
course always under lisps and giggles, various attempts to interlock their arms
and legs, crouching together. In the twighlight, one would only see a big ball.
But despite this, one would know from experience in daylight that they were
unfortunately attentive observers, always staring at K, observing even through
such childish games and nonsense as shaping their hands into telescopes, and
even when they just squinted and chiefly seemed to occupy themselves with their
beards, of which they thought very highly and which they, countless times,
compared the length and fullness of, letting Frieda judge.

K. often looked over from his bed at the activities of the three in complete
indifference.

When he felt strong enough to leave his bed, everyone hurried towards him with
their service. He wasn't yet strong enough to defend against that service and
he noticed that he thereby fell into a certain dependence on them, possibly
with poor consequences, but he had to let it happen. And it was also hardly
disagreeable to sit at the table and drink the good coffee that Frieda got for
him, or to warm up by the stove that Fridea lit, or to let the assistants in
their zeal and clumsiness run up and down the stairs to bring him laundry,
soap, and a mirror and finally, because K. had pronounced a quiet wish, to get
a small glass of rum. In the middle of this order and of their service,, K.
said, more out of a comfortable whim than in the hopes of success: "Now go
away, you two. I don't need you anymore and would like to speak to Ms. Frieda
alone." And when he didn't immediately see any resistance on their face, he
said, further, to compensate: "We three will then go to the mayor, who's
expecting me in the inn." Improbably, they obeyed, though they said, prior to
leaving, "We could also wait here." And K. answered: "I know, but I don't want
you to."

It was annoying, though in a certain sense welcome to K. when Frieda, who sat
immediately on K.'s lap after the assistants had left, said: "What do you have
against the assistants, Darling? We don't need to keep secrets from them.
They're loyal." --- "Loyal," said K., "They're constantly ambushing me, it's
senseless, it's awful!" --- "I belive I understand --- "I believe I
understand," she said, holding on to his neck, and, though she wanted to say
more, she found that she couldn't. And because the armchair was already next to
the bed, she hesitated over it before they fell into it. She lay there, though
not so devotedly as through their first night. She searched for something and
he searched for something,
